# GitHub_Actions
This repository is a hands-on exploration of GitHub Actions. It includes a simple workflow that demonstrates how GitHub Actions work and how they can be used to automate tasks within the software development lifecycle. This project is part of my journey to understand CI/CD concepts and integrate automation into development workflows.
